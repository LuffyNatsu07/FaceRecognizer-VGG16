# FaceREcognizer-VGG16
There are some of good pre-trained models available over Internet created by some good students, I used VGG16 model for my face recognizer by which anyone can easily detect any persons face just  have to give dataset of images as per need of user. This can be used to Attendance System or CCTV face detection algorithms and many more just feel free to fork this repository to use as per your need.
